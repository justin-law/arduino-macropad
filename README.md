# arduino-macropad

Code for a macropad with media control and rotary encoder.

Contains 4 buttons with functionality for:
  1. Media play/pause
  2. Media skip
  3. Computer sleep
  4. Computer wake/unlock

The rotary encoder currently acts as volume control. The click on the rotary encoder has not been wired, and the code actually is currently for a mechanical switch.

Requires the HID-Project library
