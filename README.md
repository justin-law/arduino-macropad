# arduino-macropad

Code for a macropad with media control and rotary encoder. 

Contains 4 buttons with functionality for:
  1. Media play/pause
  2. Media skip
  3. Computer sleep
  4. Computer wake/unlock

The rotary encoder currently acts as volume control. It also has a click function.

Currently, the keys are bound to write 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Look at the comments in the file for the correct commands for media controls.

Requires the HID-Project library. Add the library through Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries and searching the library name.
